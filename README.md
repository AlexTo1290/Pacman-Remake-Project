# COMP16321-Labs


## Description
This is a remake of the Pac-man arcade game in Python using the Tkinter library.

Difficulty of the game is managed by the following parameters: _movement speed of the player_, _movement speed of ghosts_, and _probability of ghosts calculating direct path to player (per second)_. 
As the level increments, these parameters are increased.

The aim of this project is to create an entertaining game using the Tkinter library which uses pathfinding algorithms as a way of improving the overall game mechanics.
