# COMP16321-Labs


## Description
This is a remake of the Pac-man arcade game in Python using the Tkinter library. Pathfinding algorithms have been utilised to calculate the ghost's paths to the user.

Difficulty of the game is managed by the following parameters: movement speed of the player, movement speed of ghosts, and probability of ghosts calculating direct path to player (per second). As the level increments, these parameters are increased.
